## Issues (Contributors Needed)

The application needs aid with minor responsive-layout issues. There are a lot of media queries being used, some that aren't being utilised correctly. If you have the time to make any tweaks for creating a more responsive layout, please feel free to let me know.
<br>
Right now, the responsiveness is quite good but needs several improvements in terms of code optimisimation (such as using the clamp() function for media queries) and also target more realistic screen sizes. Thanks.
